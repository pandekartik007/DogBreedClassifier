# Project Overview
In this project, we will learn how to build a model that can be used to process real-world images. 
Given an image of a dog, this algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 

## Project Motivation

The goal is that by completing this project, we understand the challenges involved in building a cnn model that can effectively classify images with high accuracy. 

## Description

- All the code is present in the dog_app.ipynb file with explanation about the model used.
- Best models are saved in the saved_models folder.
- All the files to run the code are available in github repository.

## Libraries
- numpy
- cv2
- keras
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- extract_bottleneck_features
- PIL

## Conclusion
 A successful project with great results and accuracy. The cnn architecture gives an accuracy >82%. All the test images are identified and predicted correctly.
